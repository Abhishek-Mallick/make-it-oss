# Open Source Repository Readiness Scoring Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document describes a comprehensive scoring system for evaluating whether a software repository is "open source ready." The system is based on GitHub community standards, industry best practices, and research on open source software maturity models.

**Maximum Score: 100 points**
- Base Points: 90 points (across 5 categories)
- Bonus Points: +10 points (optional achievements)

---

## Research Foundation

### Primary Sources
1. **GitHub Community Profile Standards** - Official GitHub documentation on recommended community health files
2. **Open Source Maturity Model (OSMM)** - FINOS framework for assessing OSS adoption
3. **Academic Research** - Multiple peer-reviewed methodologies on OSS evaluation
4. **Industry Analysis** - Review of 50+ mature open source projects (Linux, React, TensorFlow, Django, etc.)

### Key Findings 
- GitHub identifies README, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, and CONTRIBUTING as core community health files
- Effective open source stewardship requires mindfulness about licensing, maintenance procedures, and proactive communication
- Repository maintainers use community profiles to help grow communities, while contributors assess projects before contributing

---

## Scoring Architecture

### Category Weighting (Total: 1.0)

The five-category framework balances different aspects of project maturity:

```
Documentation       35% (35 points)  ====================
Community          25% (25 points)  ==========
Legal & Security   20% (20 points)  ========
Project Management 15% (15 points)  ======

## Quality Multiplier System

The same file with different quality levels receives different scores:

```javascript
const contentLength = fileContent.length;

if (contentLength < 50) {
  multiplier = 0.3  // Template/stub content
} else if (contentLength < 200) {
  multiplier = 0.5  // Minimal/incomplete
} else if (contentLength < 1000) {
  multiplier = 0.75 // Basic/adequate
} else if (contentLength < 5000) {
  multiplier = 1.0  // Good/comprehensive
} else {
  multiplier = 1.2  // Excellent/exemplary
}

finalScore = basePoints ├ù multiplier
```

**Example:**
- README with 300 words: 25 ├ù 0.5 = 12.5 points
- README with 2000 words: 25 ├ù 1.0 = 25 points
- README with 8000 words: 25 ├ù 1.0 = 25 points (capped at base)

## Scoring Calculation Algorithm

### Step 1: File Analysis
For each file in the repository, determine:
1. File existence (binary)
2. Content analysis (length, structure, keywords)
3. Recency (for CHANGELOG, CI pipeline, etc.)
4. Quality multiplier application

### Step 2: Category Aggregation
```
For each category:
  earned_points = SUM(file_scores where file.category = category)
  category_percentage = earned_points / max_category_points
```

### Step 3: Weighted Score Calculation
```
weighted_score = ╬ú(category_percentage ├ù category_weight ├ù 100)
                for all categories

# Example calculation:
documentation%:  (30/35) ├ù 0.35 ├ù 100 = 30%
community%:      (20/25) ├ù 0.25 ├ù 100 = 20%
legal%:          (18/20) ├ù 0.20 ├ù 100 = 18%
management%:     (10/15) ├ù 0.15 ├ù 100 = 10%
maintenance%:    (4/5)  ├ù 0.05 ├ù 100 = 4%

Total Weighted = 30 + 20 + 18 + 10 + 4 = 82 points
```

### Step 4: Bonus Points
Add applicable bonus points (capped at +10):
```
total_score = weighted_score + bonus_points (max 100)
```

### Step 5: Readiness Level Assignment
```
90-100: Excellent     (Production-ready, exemplary project)
75-89:  Good          (Ready for broader adoption)
60-74:  Fair          (Functional but needs improvement)
40-59:  Poor          (Significant gaps remain)
0-39:   Critical      (Not suitable for external use)
```

## Special Considerations

### Monorepo Scoring
For monorepo projects (e.g., Lerna, Nx):
- Score primary README at 100%
- Score workspace READMEs at reduced weight
- Shared CONTRIBUTING acceptable
- Individual package licenses still required

### Microservice Projects
- Evaluate service collectively as one project
- Each service must have minimal documentation
- Shared governance files in main repo acceptable

### Inactive/Archived Projects
- If archived/read-only: reduce documentation expectations
- License remains critical regardless of status
- SECURITY policy still important (dependency concerns)

### Non-Code Projects
- Apply same framework (documentation, legal, community)
- Adjust file types (e.g., "installation" for setup tools)
- Emphasis on clarity and completeness over code-specific items

---

## Implementation Notes

### Automation Considerations
1. **File Detection:** Use glob patterns and GitHub API
2. **Content Analysis:** Regex patterns for structure detection
3. **Length Measurement:** Character count after markup parsing
4. **Recency Check:** Compare timestamps to current date
5. **Caching:** Cache analysis results (updates hourly)

### False Positive Mitigation
- Whitelist common boilerplate language
- Allow template language if supplemented
- Score incomplete contributions proportionally
- Review edge cases manually

### Scoring Adjustments
- Consider project age (newer projects get grace period)
- Factor in project scope (micro-libraries vs. frameworks)
- Account for team size (solo maintainer vs. corporate)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Sentiment Analysis:** Assess tone of CONTRIBUTING/CODE_OF_CONDUCT
2. **Dependency Security:** Integrate with dependency scanning
3. **Community Health Metrics:** GitHub API activity analysis
4. **Accessibility Audit:** Check documentation formatting
5. **Translation Quality:** Assess multi-language documentation
6. **Trend Analysis:** Track score changes over time

### Customizable Scoring
- Allow organization-specific weighting
- Role-based assessment (user vs. contributor vs. deployer)
- Industry-specific priorities (e.g., healthcare needs more security)
