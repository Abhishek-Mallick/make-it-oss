## Security Overview
The following document describes various aspects of make-it-oss security. This will continue to evolve alongside our development process, and nothing here is considered final. We appreciate any and all feedback.

### 3rd Party Security Audits
At the time of writing, make-it-oss has not undergone any third-party security audits. As a matter of policy, we will not publish these reports publicly until we have completed our internal review process.

### Bug Bounty Program
Currently, make-it-oss does not have a paid bug bounty program due to financial constraints. We expect this to change in the future; however, there are no guarantees. Retrospective grants may be considered on a case-by-case basis for significant vulnerabilities reported during this period.
